# My Repository at Campus 42 Barcelona

Welcome to my repository at Campus 42 Barcelona! This is where I store my projects and exercises as I learn C and, in the future, C++. Each project represents a significant step in my programming journey.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Libft**
Implementation of the C standard library to strengthen my skills with fundamental functions.
